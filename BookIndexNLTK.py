# Combinations of words that often co-occur are called collocations.
# An example of collocations is bigrams, that is a list of word pairs. 
# Similar to that is trigrams (a combination of three words), and so forth (i.e. n-grams).

# extracting n-grams

finder = BigramCollocationFinder.from_words(words)

# ignore all bigrams that occur at least "n" times

# print 30 most frequent bigrams
